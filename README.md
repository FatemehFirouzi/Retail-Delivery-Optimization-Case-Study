Cleaning and formatting of various columns like date and categorical variables to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Mathematical Modeling:
Development of a mathematical delivery-cost equation considering various factors like distance, delivery type, and seasonality to understand the influence on delivery costs.
- Data Visualization:
Utilizing libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, you created various visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to uncover patterns and insights in the data.
- Statistical Analysis:
Conducting correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different variables, particularly how they affect delivery costs.
Linear regression analysis to identify significant predictors of delivery charges and their impact.
- Geospatial Analysis:
Analysis of customer locations in relation to warehouse locations, including visualization of customer distribution and delivery radius.
- Feature Engineering:
Creation of new features, such as one-hot encoding for categorical variables like seasons and delivery types, to facilitate more in-depth analysis.
- Data Aggregation and Analysis:
Aggregating data to derive insights into customer distribution, order quantities, and warehouse effectiveness.
- Insights and Recommendations:
Drawing actionable insights from the analysis, such as potential for warehouse consolidation, delivery area optimization, and customer segmentation strategies.
Providing business recommendations based on data-driven findings to optimize delivery strategies and improve efficiency.

## Business Objectives

My primary objectives for this business case analysis are as follows:

1. **Delivery Cost Optimization:** Develop a mathematical delivery-cost equation to understand the factors influencing delivery cost and their respective coefficients.

2. **Warehouse Strategy:** Analyze the effectiveness of our three warehouses and propose strategies to enhance our delivery strategy, including warehouse placement and delivery radius.

3. **Customer Insights:** Gain actionable insights into customer distribution, preferences, and expedited delivery choices to tailor our services effectively.

## Data and Tools

I will conduct the analysis using Python, leveraging the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The dataset contains information about orders, customers, warehouses, and delivery-related metrics for 2019.

## Methodology

I will follow a structured approach to address each objective, including data cleaning, mathematical modeling, and visualization. The analysis will lead to actionable recommendations for improving delivery services for Enterprise clients.

Let's embark on this journey of data-driven optimization!

# Business Insight
Here are some suggestion can be applied:

### Combine Warehouses: 
The Customer Locations plot shows that all three warehouses appear to be in the same geographic location. This redundancy may result in unnecessary operational costs. To improve efficiency and reduce overhead, following capacity assesment, consider merging these warehouses into one central location can be an option. This consolidation can streamline inventory management, reduce transportation costs, and simplify order fulfillment. 

### Delivery Area Tweaks: 
Overlapping delivery zones can lead to inefficiencies and increased delivery times. By fine-tuning the delivery areas to avoid overlaps, the company can ensure that each warehouse serves a distinct geographic region, minimizing redundancies and delays.

### Efficient Routes: 
Planning efficient delivery routes is essential for timely and cost-effective order fulfillment. Factors such as traffic conditions, delivery times, and route optimization algorithms can be employed to create smarter routes. Utilizing GPS and route planning software can help drivers navigate efficiently, reducing fuel consumption and delivery times.

### Customer Groups: 
Grouping customers based on their geographic location and preferences can lead to more customized and efficient delivery schedules. By analyzing customer data, the company can identify clusters of customers in specific areas. Tailoring delivery times and frequency to these groups can enhance customer satisfaction and reduce delivery costs.

### Data Enrichment: 
Consider enriching the dataset may include real-time traffic data, weather conditions, and historical delivery performance. Incorporating external data sources can enhance route planning and delivery time estimations.

### Inventory Management: 
Evaluate inventory levels at each warehouse and implement just-in-time inventory practices to minimize storage costs. By optimizing stock levels and replenishing inventory as needed, the company can reduce warehousing expenses and avoid overstocking.

### Customer Feedback: 
Continuously collect and analyze customer feedback to identify pain points in the delivery process. 


### Stock Management:
Use demand forecasting to stock items efficiently and prevent overstocking or shortages.

## Conclusion:

In this case analysis conducted using Python, I examined factors affecting delivery cost and made insightful observations. Here are the key takeaways:

Delivery Cost Equation: I developed a mathematical delivery cost equation that takes into account various factors, including distance to the nearest warehouse, expedited delivery, coupon discounts, delivery charges, and seasonal effects. This equation allows us to estimate the delivery cost for each order.

Correlation Analysis: I found that delivery cost is strongly correlated with factors such as delivery charges, choosing expedited delivery, and certain seasons (e.g., Spring). Conversely, factors like season_Winter, choosing non-expedited delivery, and specific items tend to reduce the delivery cost.

Data Visualization: Scatter plots revealed that there is a relationship between delivery cost and the distance to the nearest warehouse. However, the impact of distance is relatively weak, with only 4% of the variance in delivery cost explained by this factor.

Outlier Handling: I addressed outliers in the 'distance_to_nearest_warehouse' column by replacing them with the closest warehouse's distance, ensuring that extreme values do not skew the analysis.

Warehouse Network: I visualized customer locations and discovered that all three warehouses are concentrated in the same area, indicating potential inefficiencies in the warehouse network.

Based on these findings, I offer the following actionable insights:

Warehouse Consolidation: Consider consolidating multiple warehouses into a central location to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs. This will also resolve issues related to overlapping coverage.

Delivery Area Optimization: Adjust delivery areas to eliminate overlap and enhance order allocation efficiency.

Route Planning: Implement smarter route planning for deliveries to save time and resources, taking into account factors like traffic and delivery times.

Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on their location and preferences to create customized delivery schedules and improve customer satisfaction.

Inventory Management: Utilize demand forecasting techniques to optimize inventory levels, preventing both overstocking and shortages.

In conclusion, this Python-based case analysis offers valuable insights into factors impacting delivery cost and provides actionable recommendations to optimize the delivery and warehouse network, ultimately enhancing efficiency and customer service.
